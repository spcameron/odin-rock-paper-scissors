This is the third project in TOP. The goal of this project is to create a script-based
implementation of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" to be played between one player and the computer
in the console. Later projects will update the project with a GUI and other improvements.

# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is the third project in TOP. The original goal of this project is to create a script-based implementation of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" to be played between one player and the computer in the console. In a later lesson, I revisited this project to implement a more complete webpage that uses a user interface and JS script to play the game interactively. I learned quite a bit about how to refactor an existing code structure without having to start from scratch, as well as how to use our new JS skills such as event listeners and DOM manipulation. It was also valuable to dig into the CSS tools again, since those skills had grown a bit rusty and benefited from brushing up.

I have also relied on a top-rated project submission by michalosman for the sophisticated endgame modal and overlay. His project can be found at github.com/michalosman/rock-paper-scissors.
